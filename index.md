## About Me

Hello! My name is Kailin Koch. I enjoy digging into messy data projects, especially those involving language. I majored in Government and minored in Spanish and East Asian Studies at Cornell University.  After graduating I worked for 5 years in research consulting, data analytics and product management before heading to graduate school. I studied data science at UC Berkeley's School of Information. In my free time I enjoy paddling on a dragonboat team and doing yoga.

## Works in Progress

## My Academic Projects
_Graduate_
- [Graduate School Capstone Project](https://gjkls-mims.github.io/capstone-website/). Created a dashboard with 4 classmates as part of a semester long capstone project. The dashboard visualizes women's representation in the media over time and by outlet. We built this dashboard for ReThink Media, a Berkeley nonprofit. 
- [Predicting Code Switches in a Bilingual Podcast](https://github.com/kailinkoch/info-256/blob/main/KailinKoch_CodeSwitchPredictions%20(2).pdf) This was my final project for Applied Natural Language Processing, completed with teammate Jackie Hu. We built models to predict which words in a bilingual podcast would be a code switch from one language to another.
- [The Road to 5G Adoption: A Network Analysis](https://kailinkoch.github.io/network-5G/) As a final project for IT Economics, I used a graph network cascade model to simulate 5G adoption rates based on payoff values and adoption thresholds.
- [A Recipe for Success Recipe2Vec](https://github.com/kailinkoch/recipe-word2vec/blob/main/recipe_for_success_presentaiton.pdf)
- [Visualizing Changing Bike Share Patterns in Covid 2020](https://github.com/kailinkoch/baywheels-project/wiki/Insights-from-baywheels-project) Using data from SF's BayWheels bike program, I built a dynamic visualization of bike share behavior in San Francisco January - June 2020.
- [Airplane Data Engineering Pipeline](https://kailinkoch.github.io/airline-dbt/). I created a dbt pipeline for ingesting and summarizing airline data as part of a final data engineering project.

_Undergraduate_
- ["Mental Health Parity in Action? An Examination of Medical Expenditure 2009-2012"](https://github.com/kailinkoch/kailin-website/blob/main/Mental%20Health%20Parity%20in%20Action_%20An%20Examination%20of%20Medical%20Expenditure%202009-2012.docx.pdf). Presented novel research at Government Honor Society Pi Sigma Alpha National Conference February 2015.
- Conducted experiments to support CSCW article ["Effects of Sensemaking Translucence on Distributed Collaborative Analysis"](http://www.teshgoyal.info/Goyal_CSCW2016_preprint.pdf) (Goyal and Fussell, 2016)
- Performed research for _Incarceration Nation_ by Peter Enns and _Dictators at War and Peace_ by Jessica Weeks
