## About Me

Hello! My name is Kailin Koch. I enjoy digging into messy data projects, especially those involving language. I majored in Government and minored in Spanish and East Asian Studies at Cornell University.  After graduating I worked for 5 years in research consulting, data analytics and product management before heading to graduate school. I studied data science at UC Berkeley's School of Information.
